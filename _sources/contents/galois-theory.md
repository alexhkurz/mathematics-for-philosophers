# Galois Theory

Why can there be no formula to solve the quintic? How to prove sth like this?

One should show the elementary proof by Galois and then explain how and why that gave rise to modern Galois theory. This would be a nice example of the "tower of abstractions" that modern mathematics is building. One could discuss the importance of these towers of abstractions to mathematics, science and (software) engineering.
