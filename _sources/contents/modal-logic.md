# Modal Logic

(... to be started ... we will assume a one semester course on symbolic logic)

Some philosophers who made contributions to modal logic

- C. I. Lewis 
- Arthur Prior
- Jaakko Hintikka, 
- Saul Kripke
- David Lewis
- ...

Conversely, modal logic has applications to philosophy ... I'd be curious to look at Williamson's "Modal Logic as Metaphysics", see eg [this review](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/modal-logic-as-metaphysics/) ... and of course Kripke (Naming and Necessity) and David Lewis (Counterfactuals, Causality) ...

## Introduction

... dont know yet what the best way is to introduce modal logic from the point of view of philosphy ... maybe essential properties ...
