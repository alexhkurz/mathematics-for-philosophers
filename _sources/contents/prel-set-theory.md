# Set Theory

(May 31)

Set theory starts with $\in$, which is the only non-logical symbol. (The logical symbols are $\neg,\wedge,\vee,\Rightarrow,\exists,\forall,(,),x,y,z,P,Q,R,\ldots$.)

Everything else, including all of mathematics, can be defined/encoded in terms of these symbols. How is that suppose to work?

For a first example we can define the subset relation from the elementship relation:

$a \subseteq b \ \stackrel {\rm def} \Leftrightarrow \ \forall x\,.x\in a \Rightarrow x\in b$

We can think of $a$ as a property that the elements of $b$ may, or may not, have. 

For example

**Proposition:** The empty set is a subset of any set. In symbols $\forall $
