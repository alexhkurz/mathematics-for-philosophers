# Introduction

(... under construction ...)

These notes are the results of conversations between Alexander Kurz, a mathematician, and Johanna Speiser, an undergraduate philosophy student. The written order does not reflect how these conversations developed. One may say that these notes are only a frozen picture. Their main purpose is to remind the authors of the work we have done and to help motivating us to continue in the future.

Most chapters are empty at the moment because we either didnt start yet or the current notes are too sketchy to put them here.
