# Model Theory

Undergraduate philosophy typically (?) has a symbolic logic course covering some basic proof theory. 

But Tarskian semantics gives a completely different view of logic ...  

the circle of explanations comes up again ... 

the big question is what is "meaning" ... wide-ranging ramifications for philosophy of language and philosophy in general ... 

if we dont have a good answer for a narrow question such as "what is the meaning of logic", what hope is there to answer big questions such as what is the meaning of language or what is the meaning of life?

we will also need this to understand modal logic, to understand concepts such as "necessary", "always", "possible", "knowledge", "causality", counterfactuals, etc
